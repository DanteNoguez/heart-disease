# Heart disease

Analyzing a sample from the heart disease data set from the UCI MLR (cfr. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease). I explore whether the differences between heart disease, heart rate, chest pain and resting blood presure (in mm Hg) are significant or not using some statistical tests (Chi-squared, two sample t-test, ANOVA and Tukey's HSD). This is a project from the wonderful Data Science course in Codecademy.

R Plus Seven by ONP, Crush by Floating Points and Munarvagr by Danheim were listened to during my coding session.
